##### Mason L.
"I like the Spokane Valley Moose because the practices are super fun. The races are great because they are not that far away and the courses are always well planned out"

##### Ben C.
"Love it, 10/10 would recomend. I realy enjoy riding my bike and this is a way to ride my bike with the community. This community is, in my opinion, the nicest in the world. Each and every rider is willing to help with whatever you need whether mechanical problems with your bike or emotional problems."
