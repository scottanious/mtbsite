##### Mason Lyttle
"I like the Spokane valley moose because the practices are super fun and the races are great because they are not that far away and the courses are always well planned out"

##### Ben Currie 
"love it 10/10 would recomend. I realy enjoy riding my bike and this is a way to ride my bike with the community. This community is in my opinion the nicest in the world. Each and every rider is willing to help with whatever you need wether mechanical problems with your bike or emotional problems."
