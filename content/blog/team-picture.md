While 2021 wasn't free of COVID impacts, we still held a modified season.  This meant no races, but we broke into smaller groups and made tons of memories in the process.

My favorite part was to watch each athlete progress and do better over each of the 2 six week sessions.  The progress that can be made in skill and endurance is amazing.

At the end of the year we were able to get together as a group outdoors and celebrate the accomplishments and send off our seniors in style.
