[about]
    title = "Meet the Moose!"
    description = "<p>The Washington Student Cycling League is a holistic mountain bike program for students grade 6-12. The Spokane Valley Composite team is for any student in the greater Spokane Valley.  If you're in Spokane, the Inland Composite team is for your area.  Please visit <a href='https://bikesaretheanswer.org'>BikesAreTheAnswer.org</a> for more information.</p><p>Our main program starts with indoor winter spin sessions, and as soon as we see dirt we can't wait to get outside.  We typically practice two days per week, usually Tuesday 5:30-7pm and Saturday from 9am-11am.  We will have groups of riders and coaches that go out and focus on all aspects of riding from drills and techniques to endurance riding, but most of all, fun!  This all builds to the WSCL race season where youth from all over the state gather and compete, but most of all have a good time. </p>"
