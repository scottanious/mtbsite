# mtbsite

This repo is the source code for the website [SpokaneMTB.org](https://www.spokanemtb.org).  It's hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://mtbsite.pages.dev), 
and we plan to use [Forestry](https://forestry.io) to edit the code most of the time.  

It's a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site and was started with the theme from [Future Imperfect Slim](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim).
